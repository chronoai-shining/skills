# Agent Manual

> **Paste this whole skill into an AI agent's system context.** The skill ships as `SKILL.md` (this file: workflow patterns + recipes) plus `references/api-reference.md` (full per-endpoint catalogue + error legend). Once loaded, the agent can operate every Ornn capability end-to-end via the `nyxid` CLI — discover skills, pull skills, execute skills, create new skills, manage its own skill library, share skills, react to audit notifications. No SDK. No MCP. Just the CLI.
>
> Ornn's product is **Skill-as-a-Service for AI agents.** Skills are packaged AI capabilities (a `SKILL.md` prompt + optional scripts + YAML metadata) that any agent can pull and execute. This manual is the contract between Ornn and you.

## §0. Updating this manual

This manual is itself an Ornn skill (`name: ornn-agent-manual`). Its source of truth is the Ornn registry, not a static docs page. There is no separate URL to fetch — pull a fresh copy through the same API every other skill flows through.

**Whenever you (the agent) want to check for an update, follow these steps verbatim:**

1. Pull the latest version of this skill from Ornn:

   ```bash
   nyxid proxy request ornn-api \
     "/api/v1/skills/ornn-agent-manual/json" \
     --method GET --output json
   ```

2. The response is `{ data: { name, description, metadata, files: { "SKILL.md": "...", "references/api-reference.md": "..." } } }`. Read the YAML frontmatter at the top of `SKILL.md` and find the `version:` field.

3. Compare it to the `version:` in **your loaded copy** (the frontmatter at the top of this file). If they match, you are current — stop here.

4. If the published version is newer:
   - List every version available by calling `GET /api/v1/skills/ornn-agent-manual/versions`. The response has one row per version, newest first.
   - Ask the user which version they want to load (they may want to pin to an older one for reproducibility).
   - Once the user picks, fetch with `GET /api/v1/skills/ornn-agent-manual/json?version=<X.Y>` and replace your context with the new `SKILL.md` (and `references/api-reference.md` if they consume it). The new content's frontmatter overwrites the old.

5. If you encounter `AUDIT_NOT_FOUND` / `SKILL_NOT_FOUND` errors in step 1, the registry instance you are pointing at has not published the skill yet. Keep operating on the version you have. The Ornn API is backwards-compatible within `/api/v1`, so older manuals continue to produce valid calls — you will only miss capabilities introduced in newer versions.

If `nyxid` is unavailable or the proxy is unreachable, keep operating on the version you have. Do not retry-loop the update check; treat it as a once-per-session inquiry the user can re-trigger explicitly.

---

## §0.5 Tracking and re-checking installed Ornn skills

You **must** remember every Ornn skill you install (or hold in conversation context) as `{ name, ornnGuid, installedVersion }` — keep this in your working memory or, if your runtime supports it, persistent local state. This list is the source of truth for "which capabilities did the user pull from Ornn?".

**Before you actually execute an installed Ornn skill** on the user's task, check whether a newer version exists. The check is one API call:

```bash
nyxid proxy request ornn-api \
  "/api/v1/skills/<name-or-guid>/versions" \
  --method GET --output json
```

(Or the equivalent unauthenticated `GET /api/v1/skills/<idOrName>/versions` for a public skill — see §3.3 for fetch alternatives.)

The response is `{ items: [{ version, skillHash, createdOn, isDeprecated, deprecationNote, releaseNotes, ... }, ...] }` sorted newest-first. Compare `items[0].version` to your installed version and act:

- **Same version** → execute as-is.
- **Newer version available** → tell the user `"Skill <name> has a newer version <X.Y> (you have <A.B>). Release notes: <releaseNotes>. Update? (y/n)"`. If yes, re-fetch the package (§3.3), overwrite the local copy, update the tracked `installedVersion`, then execute.
- **Your installed version is `isDeprecated: true`** → warn with the `deprecationNote` and recommend updating before executing.
- **Skill 404s** → the skill was deleted or hidden from you; tell the user and ask whether to keep using the local copy or stop.

Skip this update check only when the user has explicitly pinned a version for reproducibility (`?version=<X.Y>`).

If the skill is tied to a NyxID admin service (a "system skill" — `isSystemSkill: true`), the audit pipeline can also notify you mid-session via `GET /api/v1/notifications` (§3.13). Treat any `audit.risky_for_consumer` notification as a hard signal to stop, surface it to the user, and ask before continuing.

---

## §1. Prerequisites

Every API call in this manual is executed through the **NyxID CLI** (`nyxid`). NyxID sits in front of Ornn: it handles OAuth login, token refresh, and proxies authenticated HTTP requests to Ornn. You never talk to Ornn directly.

### 1.1 Install the NyxID CLI

Download the `nyxid` binary from the NyxID releases page and place it on your `$PATH`. Verify:

```bash
nyxid --version
```

### 1.2 Log in

```bash
nyxid login
```

Opens a browser for the OAuth authorization-code flow. On success, tokens are stored under `~/.nyxid/` and persist across invocations. Tokens auto-refresh; you rarely need to log in again.

### 1.3 Verify identity and permissions

```bash
nyxid whoami
```

Expected output includes `user_id`, `email`, `roles`, and `permissions`. For any non-trivial Ornn operation, confirm the permission list contains at least:

- `ornn:skill:read`
- `ornn:skill:create`
- `ornn:skill:build`
- `ornn:playground:use`

If a permission is missing, your NyxID admin needs to grant the corresponding role (typically `ornn-user`). Without these, every write call returns `403` with `error.code = "FORBIDDEN"` and a `Missing permission: <perm>` message. The full permission catalogue lives in `references/api-reference.md`.

### 1.4 Discover the Ornn service

```bash
nyxid proxy discover --output json
```

The response lists every service the authenticated user can reach through NyxID. Confirm an entry with `"slug": "ornn-api"` is present. From this point on, every Ornn call in this manual uses the slug `ornn-api`.

---

## §2. Core Workflows

Ornn exposes ~50 endpoints, but almost all real agent usage reduces to the three workflows below. Internalize these first; the per-endpoint mechanics live in `references/api-reference.md`.

### 2.1 Discover → Pull → Execute

**Intent:** you need a capability you do not already have. Ornn may already host a skill for it.

| Step | Action | API |
|------|--------|-----|
| 1 | Search the registry by keyword or meaning | `GET /api/v1/skill-search` |
| 2 | Pick the best match (highest score, or best name) | (client-side) |
| 3 | Pull the full skill content | `GET /api/v1/skills/:idOrName/json` |
| 4 | Read `SKILL.md` and follow its instructions | (agent reads content) |
| 5a | *If `plain` skill:* follow the prompt and emit output | — |
| 5b | *If `runtime-based` / `mixed`:* execute scripts locally, or open the playground for managed execution | `POST /api/v1/playground/chat` |

CLI example:

```bash
# 1. Search
nyxid proxy request ornn-api \
  "/api/v1/skill-search?query=korean+translation&mode=semantic&scope=public&pageSize=5" \
  --method GET --output json

# 3. Pull the best match by name
nyxid proxy request ornn-api \
  "/api/v1/skills/any-language-to-korean-translation/json" \
  --method GET --output json
```

The `/json` variant returns the skill as a `{ name, description, metadata, files }` structure where `files` maps each relative path in the package to its full text content. Use this instead of the `presignedPackageUrl` that `GET /skills/:idOrName` returns — you avoid a second HTTP hop to storage and you get every file in one envelope.

### 2.2 Build → Package → Upload

**Intent:** you need a capability that does not exist. Have Ornn's LLM generate it, or package one yourself, then publish to the registry.

| Step | Action | API |
|------|--------|-----|
| 1 | Generate via AI from prompt / source / OpenAPI | `POST /api/v1/skills/generate*` (SSE) |
| 2 | *(or)* Author `SKILL.md` + scripts locally | — |
| 3 | Package into a ZIP with a single root folder | (local) |
| 4 | *(optional)* Validate against format rules | `POST /api/v1/skill-format/validate` |
| 5 | Upload | `POST /api/v1/skills` |

See §3.1 for the upload recipe and §3.7 for the AI-generation recipe.

### 2.3 Try → Share → Audit-aware

**Intent:** after building a skill, test it interactively, share it with a user / org / the public, and let the audit verdict travel as a passive label + notification rather than as a gate.

| Step | Action | API |
|------|--------|-----|
| 1 | Test in the playground with real inputs | `POST /api/v1/playground/chat` (SSE) |
| 2 | Owner edits the sharing allow-list (this is what "shares" the skill) | `PUT /api/v1/skills/:id/permissions` |
| 3 | Owner (or any consumer) triggers an audit on the current version | `POST /api/v1/skills/:idOrName/audit` |
| 4 | Watch the notifications feed for the audit verdict | `GET /api/v1/notifications` |

Sharing is **unconditional**. There is **no separate share endpoint**. There is no audit gate, no waiver, no review queue. The backend stores the desired `isPrivate` / `sharedWithUsers` / `sharedWithOrgs` exactly as the owner sets them.

Audit is a **passive risk label**:

- A skill that has never been audited shows as *not yet audited*.
- A completed audit produces a verdict — `green` (low risk), `yellow` (some findings), or `red` (serious findings) — that decorates the skill in the UI / API.
- When an audit completes, the **owner** is always notified (`audit.completed`). When the verdict is `yellow` or `red`, **every consumer** (everyone in `sharedWithUsers`, plus every member of every org in `sharedWithOrgs`) is also notified (`audit.risky_for_consumer`) so they can decide whether to keep using the skill.

---

## §3. Use Cases

Each subsection is a complete recipe — copy it verbatim, substitute the obvious arguments, and it works. For full request / response shapes, error codes, and edge cases, cross-reference `references/api-reference.md`.

### 3.1 Upload a new skill

**When:** you have a local directory (or generated output) you want to publish.

```bash
# 1. Arrange the package. The ZIP must contain a single root folder named
#    after your skill (kebab-case). Inside: SKILL.md is required.
#    my-skill/
#    ├── SKILL.md
#    └── scripts/   (optional)
cd ~/skills
zip -r my-skill.zip my-skill/

# 2. (Optional) Validate before upload.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/skill-format/validate" \
  --method POST \
  --data @my-skill.zip \
  --header "Content-Type: application/zip" \
  --output json

# 3. Upload. New skills default to private; flip later with §3.6.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/skills" \
  --method POST \
  --data @my-skill.zip \
  --header "Content-Type: application/zip" \
  --output json
```

On success, `data.guid` is the new skill's UUID. To bypass validation at upload time (rare — usually only for legacy packages): append `?skip_validation=true` to the path.

### 3.2 Import a skill from a public GitHub repo

**When:** the source already lives on GitHub and you want a one-shot copy that can later be re-pulled with one call.

```bash
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/skills/pull" \
  --method POST \
  --data '{
    "repo": "owner/name",
    "ref": "main",
    "path": "skills/my-skill"
  }' \
  --output json
```

`ref` accepts a branch, tag, or commit SHA; `path` narrows to a sub-directory inside the repo (use `""` for the repo root). Ornn records the source so you can later refresh:

```bash
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/skills/<id>/refresh" \
  --method POST --output json
```

Refresh re-pulls the same `repo` + `ref` (HEAD of the branch) and publishes a new version when the bytes changed.

### 3.3 Download (pull) a skill

**When:** you want to run a skill locally or inject its content into your agent.

```bash
# Option A — full JSON (preferred for agents): every file inline.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api \
  "/api/v1/skills/<idOrName>/json" \
  --method GET --output json

# Option B — just metadata + a presigned ZIP URL. Useful if you only need
# one file or want to cache the binary on disk.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api \
  "/api/v1/skills/<idOrName>" \
  --method GET --output json
# Then download the ZIP:
curl -o skill.zip "$(jq -r '.data.presignedPackageUrl' <<< "$RESPONSE")"
```

Add `?version=<X.Y>` to either call to pin to a specific version. Without it you get the latest.

### 3.4 Publish a new version

**When:** you edited an existing skill and want to release a new version.

```bash
# Bump the version in SKILL.md frontmatter (e.g. 1.2 → 1.3), re-zip,
# then PUT to the same skill id. A new immutable version is created;
# the latest pointer advances.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/skills/<id>" \
  --method PUT \
  --data @my-skill.zip \
  --header "Content-Type: application/zip" \
  --output json
```

The old version remains readable via `GET /skills/<idOrName>?version=<old>`. Consumers that did not pin a version automatically get the new one.

### 3.5 Deprecate (or un-deprecate) a version

**When:** a version has a known issue but you do not want to remove it from history.

```bash
nyxid proxy request ornn-api \
  "/api/v1/skills/<idOrName>/versions/1.2" \
  --method PATCH \
  --data '{"isDeprecated":true,"deprecationNote":"Breaks with axios >= 1.7; use 1.3+."}' \
  --output json
```

The version stays in `/versions` listings and is still resolvable, but `GET /skills/<idOrName>?version=1.2` now returns the deprecation warning headers (`X-Skill-Deprecated: true`, `X-Skill-Deprecation-Note: <urlencoded>`). Send `"isDeprecated": false` to un-deprecate.

### 3.6 Share a skill *(unconditional)*

**When:** you want to grant another user, an org, or the public access. The audit verdict — if any — is purely informational and never blocks the call.

```bash
# Replace the allow-list. The backend stores it as-is.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/skills/<id>/permissions" \
  --method PUT \
  --data '{
    "isPrivate": true,
    "sharedWithUsers": ["user_abc"],
    "sharedWithOrgs": ["org_xyz"]
  }' \
  --output json
# Response: { "data": { "skill": <updated SkillDetail> }, "error": null }
```

To revoke, send the same request with the targets removed. To make a skill public, send `"isPrivate": false`. To make it private again, send `"isPrivate": true` with empty allow-lists. The previous allow-list values are not retained when you flip to public — they are simply ignored while `isPrivate: false` is in effect.

If you also want a fresh risk verdict for the version you just shared, trigger an audit (§3.8). The owner receives an `audit.completed` notification on completion, and any `yellow` / `red` verdict additionally fans out an `audit.risky_for_consumer` notification to everyone you shared with.

### 3.7 Generate a skill with AI *(SSE)*

**When:** you need a brand-new skill and want Ornn's LLM to scaffold it.

```bash
# Single-shot prompt.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/skills/generate" \
  --method POST \
  --data '{"prompt":"Create a plain skill that detects API keys, passwords, and PII in text"}' \
  --stream

# Multi-turn refinement.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/skills/generate" \
  --method POST \
  --data '{
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Create a CSV-to-JSON skill" },
      { "role": "assistant", "content": "<previous generation>" },
      { "role": "user", "content": "Now use csv-parse, not papaparse" }
    ]
  }' \
  --stream
```

Capture the SSE stream — see `references/api-reference.md` § "SSE event shapes". When you observe `generation_complete`, `event.raw` contains the finished skill. Re-package it (§3.1) and upload.

### 3.8 Run an audit *(label, not a gate)*

**When:** you have published a new version and want to refresh the public risk verdict, or a consumer asked you to. There is no auto-trigger — the owner clicks "Start Auditing" / hits this endpoint deliberately. Sharing does not require an audit; this is purely about producing a label and notifications.

```bash
# Trigger an audit. Returns immediately at status: "running".
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/skills/<idOrName>/audit" \
  --method POST \
  --data '{"force":false}' \
  --output json

# Poll until it leaves "running".
while true; do
  STATUS=$(nyxid proxy request ornn-api \
    "/api/v1/skills/<idOrName>/audit/history" \
    --method GET --output json \
    | jq -r '.data.items[0].status')
  [ "$STATUS" != "running" ] && break
  sleep 5
done

# Read the verdict.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/skills/<idOrName>/audit" \
  --method GET --output json
```

Pass `"force": true` if you want to bypass the 30-day cache (re-audit even if the same skill bytes were just scored).

### 3.9 React to an audit-risk notification

**When:** you received an `audit.risky_for_consumer` notification for a skill someone shared with you, and you want to inspect the findings before continuing to use it.

```bash
# 1. Get the unread notifications.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/notifications?unread=true&limit=50" \
  --method GET --output json

# 2. The notification's link points at /skills/<idOrName>/audits?version=<v>.
#    Pull the audit history for that version.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/skills/<idOrName>/audit/history?version=<v>" \
  --method GET --output json

# 3. Mark the notification read.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/notifications/<id>/read" \
  --method POST --data '{}' --output json
```

Consumers cannot self-revoke today — if you decide to stop using a skill, ask the owner to drop you from `sharedWithUsers` or to unshare the org you are in.

### 3.10 Diff two versions

**When:** you want to see what changed between v1.2 and v1.3 before consuming a new release.

```bash
nyxid proxy request ornn-api \
  "/api/v1/skills/<idOrName>/versions/1.2/diff/1.3" \
  --method GET --output json
```

Response shape: `{ skill, from, to, diff: { added, removed, modified: [{ path, before, after }] } }` — file-level, with full content of modified files so the caller can render a unified diff locally.

### 3.11 Run a skill in the playground *(SSE)*

**When:** you want to test a skill end-to-end with real inputs, including script execution in the chrono-sandbox.

```bash
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/playground/chat" \
  --method POST \
  --data '{
    "skillId": "<guid or name>",
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Translate: Hello, world." }
    ],
    "envVars": { "OPENAI_API_KEY": "..." }
  }' \
  --stream
```

The backend runs a server-side tool-use loop (up to 5 rounds): when the LLM emits a `function_call` to `execute_script` or `skill_search`, Ornn auto-executes it (no client approval), feeds the result back, and keeps streaming. From the agent's side this looks like one call with a chunked response. For runtime-based skills, watch for `tool-call` with `name: "execute_script"` and the matching `tool-result` — that is the sandbox run.

### 3.12 See analytics for a skill

```bash
# Execution summary across all versions.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api \
  "/api/v1/skills/<idOrName>/analytics?window=30d" \
  --method GET --output json

# Same, narrowed to one version.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api \
  "/api/v1/skills/<idOrName>/analytics?window=30d&version=1.2" \
  --method GET --output json

# Pull time-series — last 7 days bucketed by day.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api \
  "/api/v1/skills/<idOrName>/analytics/pulls?bucket=day" \
  --method GET --output json

# Custom range, hourly buckets, single version.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api \
  "/api/v1/skills/<idOrName>/analytics/pulls?bucket=hour&from=2026-04-20T00:00:00Z&to=2026-04-21T00:00:00Z&version=1.2" \
  --method GET --output json
```

`window` values: `7d`, `30d`, `all`. `bucket` values: `hour`, `day`, `month`. Anonymous callers only see analytics for public skills.

### 3.13 Handle your notifications

```bash
# Cheap unread badge — poll this for indicators.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/notifications/unread-count" \
  --method GET --output json

# Fetch unread notifications.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/notifications?unread=true&limit=50" \
  --method GET --output json

# Mark a single one read.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/notifications/<id>/read" \
  --method POST --data '{}' --output json

# Or flush the inbox.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/notifications/mark-all-read" \
  --method POST --data '{}' --output json
```

Two notification categories are emitted today (`audit.completed`, `audit.risky_for_consumer`) — full table in `references/api-reference.md`.

### 3.14 Delete a non-latest version

**When:** an old version is broken or superseded; you want to prune storage without nuking the whole skill.

```bash
# Cannot delete the only remaining version (delete the whole skill instead)
# or the current latest version (publish a newer one first).
nyxid proxy request ornn-api \
  "/api/v1/skills/<idOrName>/versions/<X.Y>" \
  --method DELETE --output json
```

### 3.15 Tie a skill to a NyxID service *(system / personal)*

**When:** you want to mark a skill as either a platform-wide *system skill* (admin tier) or attach it to one of your personal NyxID services. The tie is a separate axis from sharing — privacy and ACL are managed via §3.6.

```bash
# 1. List the services you can tie to. Each row carries a tier:
#    "admin"    — platform-wide; tying forces the skill public.
#    "personal" — yours; tying does not change privacy.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/me/nyxid-services" \
  --method GET --output json

# 2. Tie. Tying to an admin service flips `isPrivate: false` atomically.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/skills/<id>/nyxid-service" \
  --method PUT \
  --data '{"nyxidServiceId":"<service-id>"}' \
  --output json

# 3. Untie. Leaves `isPrivate` alone.
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/skills/<id>/nyxid-service" \
  --method PUT \
  --data '{"nyxidServiceId":null}' \
  --output json
```

A skill marked `isSystemSkill: true` cannot be flipped back to private without first untying — `PUT /skills/:id/permissions` with `isPrivate: true` is rejected with `SYSTEM_SKILL_MUST_BE_PUBLIC`. Run step 3 first.

To list every skill tied to a given service:

```bash
nyxid proxy request ornn-api \
  "/api/v1/nyxid-services/<service-id>/skills?page=1&pageSize=20" \
  --method GET --output json
```

For admin (system) services, every authenticated caller can browse the list; for personal services, only the service owner (or platform admin) sees results.

To filter the registry to **only** system skills (or to exclude them):

```bash
nyxid proxy request ornn-api \
  "/api/v1/skill-search?systemFilter=only&scope=public" \
  --method GET --output json
# Or systemFilter=exclude to hide them.
```

### 3.16 Hard-delete a skill

**When:** you no longer want the skill to exist in any form.

```bash
nyxid proxy request ornn-api "/api/v1/skills/<id>" \
  --method DELETE --output json
```

This is destructive: it removes the skill record, all version records, and the storage objects. Subsequent `GET /skills/<id>` returns `404 SKILL_NOT_FOUND`. There is no undelete.

---

## §4. Conventions & Pitfalls

- **Path prefix is `/api/v1/`** — every example in this manual includes it. Dropping `/v1/` returns 404 (there is no implicit redirect).
- **Anonymous calls are rare.** `/skill-format/rules` and the public slice of `/skill-search` are the main ones. Everywhere else, `nyxid login` first.
- **ZIPs must have exactly one root folder**, named after the skill (`my-skill/SKILL.md`, not a flat `SKILL.md` at the archive root). Validation rejects either mistake.
- **Version pinning** on `GET /skills/:idOrName?version=<X.Y>` accepts `<major>.<minor>` semver — it matches the version strings in `SKILL.md` frontmatter.
- **Skill name vs guid.** Most GETs accept either; writes (`PUT /skills/:id`, `DELETE /skills/:id`, `PUT /skills/:id/permissions`) require the guid. `POST /skills` returns the guid at creation; keep it for later writes.
- **Audit record statuses** (visible on `GET /audit/history`): `running`, `completed`, `failed`. Sharing is unconditional and does not depend on audit status; the audit verdict is purely informational.
- **Audit verdicts:** `green`, `yellow`, `red`. Only `yellow` / `red` triggers the consumer fan-out notification.
- **404 on read but 403 on write.** If a private skill is hidden from you, `GET` returns 404 (not 403) so the existence of the skill is not leaked. Writes use 403 when you are authed but lack ownership / admin.
- **Identical SSE keepalives across endpoints.** Both `/skills/generate*` and `/playground/chat` emit `event: keepalive` heartbeats; ignore them.
- **Anonymous calls and visibility.** Anonymous callers querying any skill-scoped read endpoint receive 404 for private skills (never 403) and only the `public` scope on search.
- **`X-Request-ID`** is set on every response. Capture it when reporting failures — it correlates with the server log line that produced the error.

---

## §5. References & further reading

- `references/api-reference.md` — exhaustive per-endpoint catalogue: every method + path, request body schema, response shape, all error codes with HTTP mapping, auth + authorization rules. Pull this into context whenever you need the full contract for an endpoint.
- `GET /api/v1/skill-format/rules` — canonical skill package format spec, always up-to-date with what the validator enforces.
- `GET /api/v1/openapi.json` — auto-generated OpenAPI 3 schema. Every endpoint above is in here with full Zod-derived request/response types.
- `GET /api/v1/me` — reads your current identity snapshot (userId, email, displayName, roles, permissions). Useful when debugging a 403.

If you find a discrepancy between this manual and the actual API behaviour, the API is right and the manual is stale — re-pull the skill (§0) before assuming a bug.
